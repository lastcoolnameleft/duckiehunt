Here's the answer the questions that noone has asked me yet.  I'd need actual vistors before I'd have questions.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
<ul><li>
	Because.
</li></ul>

<h2>Why do you have so many duckies?</h2>
<ul><li>
My lovely wife and I were away on our honeymoon and our friends conspired towards a <?php echo anchor('http://flickr.com/photos/nmlittle/tags/duckieinvation/', 'huge rubber duckie invasion') ?>.  We came back to <?php echo anchor('http://flickr.com/photos/snoopykiss/sets/72157607146654923/', '1000+ duckies in the house') ?>.  <?php echo anchor('http://flickr.com/photos/snoopykiss/2833050713', '~300 on the bed') ?>.  Days later I went into work to find <?php echo anchor('http://flickr.com/photos/snoopykiss/2833067647', '~200 more there') ?>.  It was epic.</li></ul>

<h2>No seriously.  Why do you have so many duckies?  I think you need professional help.</h2>
<ul><li>
You might be onto something here.  It started out when I bought a hot tub.  For it's cristening, my friends and I thought it would be funny to put some rubber duckies in it.
</li>
<li>
  A few rubber duckies became quite a few duckies.
</li>
<li>  Then friends started finding speciality duckies. 
</li>
<li>
	Then friends started bringing me duckies from around the world.
</li>
<li>
	Then I got married.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Yeah, I saw that.  Congrats.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thanks!  Anyway, a number of our friends had this grand idea to supply the house and my work with duckies while we were on our <?php echo anchor ('http://flickr.com/photos/snoopykiss/sets/72157607006148637/', 'honeymoon') ?>.</li>
</ul>
